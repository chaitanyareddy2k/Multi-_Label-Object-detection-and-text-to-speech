# Multi-Label Object Detection and Text-to-Speech

A complete Computer Vision project that combines **multi-label object detection** with **text-to-speech (TTS)** capabilities.  
This repository implements a multi-label detection model using **PyTorch and ResNet-50**, and converts the detected objects into human-readable speech using text-to-speech synthesis.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to:

- Detect **multiple objects simultaneously** in an image (multi-label classification)
- Generate **audio narration** of detected objects using a text-to-speech engine

It is useful for:
- Accessibility applications
- Vision-assisted systems
- Robotics perception
- Real-time object description tools

## 🚀 Features

✔ Multi-label detection model trained on the **Pascal VOC dataset**  
✔ Uses **ResNet-50 backbone** with PyTorch  
✔ Custom preprocessing and augmentation pipeline  
✔ Text-to-Speech integration for audio output  
✔ Easy to extend and integrate with camera/real-time feeds
